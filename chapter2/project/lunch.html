    <h3>Margherita Pizza</h3>

      Here is the archetype of a thin-crust pizza pie, a pizza margherita adorned simply in the colors of the Italian flag: green from basil, white from mozzarella, red from tomato sauce. This pizza is adapted from the recipe used by the staff at Roberta’s restaurant in Brooklyn, who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. The ingredients offer in their proportions what appears to be a kind of austerity — not even 3 ounces of cheese! But the result is home-cooked pizza to beat the band, exactly the sort of recipe to start a career in home pizza-making, and to return to again and again.

      Don’t panic. This looks like a lot of work, but it’s not. Everything can be made ahead and each item in itself doesn’t take long to throw together. Additionally, many of the ingredients overlap, so you’re not buying as much as it looks like you need to. AND, lastly, there are actually several meals in here: North African Burgers, Pizza and Leftovers. You’re welcome.
