    <p>Bootstrap Component Added: I added a sidenav as the extra boostrap component where you click on the list glyphicon and it pulls up a sidenav for a link to click. For this I changed the layout of the html, added some css, and added javascript to the page.</p>

      <p>
        This pizza is full of everything good: tangy BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, tender shredded chicken,  two cheeses, more BBQ sauce and of course a drizzle of ranch dressing for good measure. We devoured this pizza in no time flat, but it is easy to make early in the day and then re-heat in the oven or toaster oven to crisp it up.

        Now about the caramelized onions- I had made a large batch earlier in the week to put on some burgers so throwing some that I already had made on this pizza was easy. They are a bit time consuming to make though, so I suggest doing that ahead of time or letting them cook down while you prep the dough and let it proof. They really add a wonderful element to this pizza- sweet and a bit smokey. Speaking of smokey- I added some smoked buffalo mozzarella to the mix which was amazing- but of course you can use any cheese you have on hand!

        Two of my favourite things combined; pizza and Moroccan flavours… bliss! This is a very simple vegan pizza with wonderful spicy flavour and it is so colourful! Homemade pizza dough is so very simple and any excess freezes well so you can make a batch and keep any left over for whipping up pizza anytime YAY!

        For non-vegans add a little feta cheese if you like; but it really doesn’t need it. Spicy and crispy, crunchy this vegetarian Moroccan Pizza is perfect for serving up to friends and family or for a quite night on the couch with good company. Bon appetite!!

        This is the only pizza I make now. We love it! Keeping the spices simple helps the flavors of the chicken and vegetables come through. The pizza tastes incredible and is good for you, too.

        My favorite homemade pizza crust topped with a vibrant pesto sauce, mozzarella, chicken. and a sprinkle of pine nuts. This pesto chicken pizza is fresh, flavorful and absolutely perfect for summer!
